[{"text":"I'll help implement the 'add' function in functions.mjs to pass the test in index.mjs. Here are the updated files:\n\n**functions.mjs**\n\n```js\nexport function add(a, b) {\n  return a + b;\n}\n```\n\n**index.mjs**\n\n```js\nimport { add } from \"./functions.mjs\";\n\n// A simple test:\nconst result = add(3, 4);\nif (result !== 7) {\n  console.error(`Test failed: expected 7, got ${result}`);\n  process.exit(1); // Exit with error code\n}\nconsole.log(\"Add test passed\");\nprocess.exit(0); // Exit successfully\n```\n\nThe implementation is straightforward - the `add` function simply returns the sum of its two parameters. The test in index.mjs verifies that 3 + 4 equals 7, which this implementation satisfies. No changes were needed to index.mjs since it was already correctly set up to test the add function.","message":{"type":"ai","data":{"content":"I'll help implement the 'add' function in functions.mjs to pass the test in index.mjs.
