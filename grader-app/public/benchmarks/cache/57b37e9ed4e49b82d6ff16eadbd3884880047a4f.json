[{"text":"I'll help implement the `toUpperCase` function in functions.mjs. Here's the complete updated file:\n\n**functions.mjs**\n\n```js\nexport function toUpperCase(str) {\n  return str.toUpperCase();\n}\n```\n\nThe index.mjs file doesn't need any changes as it's already correctly testing the function. The implementation simply uses JavaScript's built-in String prototype method `toUpperCase()` which converts all characters in the string to uppercase. This is the simplest and most efficient way to implement this functionality.\n\nThe original index.mjs test will now pass since the function correctly converts \"hello\" to \"HELLO\".\n\nWould you like me to make any other changes or additions to either file?","message":{"type":"ai","data":{"content":"I'll help implement the `toUpperCase` function in functions.mjs.
