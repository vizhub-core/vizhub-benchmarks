Here are the updated files:

**functions.mjs**

```javascript
// Entire updated code for functions.mjs
export function square(x) {
  return x * x;
}
```

The `square` function now correctly calculates the square of the input `x`.

The `index.mjs` file doesn't need any changes, as it's already using the newly implemented `square` function.
