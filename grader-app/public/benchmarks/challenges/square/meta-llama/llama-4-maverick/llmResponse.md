To implement the task as described, we first need to understand the task and the given files. The task is to implement a 'square' function in the `functions.mjs` file that returns the square of its input, `x`. The `index.mjs` file imports this function and tests it with an input of 5, expecting the result to be 25.

## Step 1: Understand the Requirements
The `square` function should take a number `x` as input and return `x*x`.

## Step 2: Implement the `square` Function
To implement the `square` function, we simply need to return the product of `x` with itself.

## Step 3: Update `functions.mjs`
We will update `functions.mjs` to include the implementation of the `square` function.

**functions.mjs**
```js
export function square(x) {
  return x * x;
}
```

## Step 4: Review `index.mjs` for Necessary Changes
The `index.mjs` file is used to test the `square` function. It imports the `square` function from `functions.mjs`, tests it with an input of 5, and checks if the result is 25. If the result is not 25, it logs an error and exits the process with a non-zero status code. Otherwise, it logs a success message and exits with a zero status code. The code seems fine for testing purposes and does not need any changes based on the task description.

**index.mjs**
```js
import { square } from "./functions.mjs";

const input = 5;
const result = square(input);
if (result !== 25) {
  console.error(`Test failed: expected 25, got ${result}`);
  process.exit(1);
}
console.log("Square test passed");
process.exit(0);
```

Since `index.mjs` does not require any changes according to the task, we do not need to include it in the refactoring. However, to follow the instructions precisely and to show that no changes are needed, we could reiterate its content, but it's not necessary as per the task's constraints.

The final answer is:

**functions.mjs**
```js
export function square(x) {
  return x * x;
}
```
