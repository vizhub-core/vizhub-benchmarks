To implement the task, we first need to understand what is being asked. The task requires implementing a 'square' function in the 'functions.mjs' file that takes a number 'x' as input and returns its square, i.e., 'x*x'. The implementation should be tested using the code provided in 'index.mjs'.

Let's start by analyzing the provided files:

1. **index.mjs**: This file imports the 'square' function from 'functions.mjs', tests it with an input of 5, and checks if the result is 25. If the result is not 25, it logs an error message and exits the process with a non-zero status code. If the test passes, it logs a success message and exits with a zero status code.

2. **functions.mjs**: This file is where the 'square' function needs to be implemented. Currently, it has a TODO comment indicating where the implementation should be added.

To implement the 'square' function, we simply need to return the square of the input 'x'. This can be achieved by multiplying 'x' by itself.

Here's how we can update the files:

**functions.mjs**

```javascript
export function square(x) {
  return x * x;
}
```

**index.mjs**

```javascript
import { square } from "./functions.mjs";

const input = 5;
const result = square(input);
if (result !== 25) {
  console.error(`Test failed: expected 25, got ${result}`);
  process.exit(1);
}
console.log("Square test passed");
process.exit(0);
```

Both files are already quite straightforward and do not require significant changes beyond implementing the 'square' function. The test in 'index.mjs' is also well-structured and effectively checks the functionality of the 'square' function.

No other files need to be updated or created for this task. The 'functions.mjs' file is the primary file that needed an update to implement the 'square' function.

Therefore, the solution involves updating 'functions.mjs' to include the implementation of the 'square' function as shown above. The rest of the code remains the same, and there are no unused files that need to be deleted.
