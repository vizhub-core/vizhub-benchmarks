I'll help you implement the `square` function in the `functions.mjs` file. Here's the solution:

**functions.mjs**

```js
export function square(x) {
  return x * x;
}
```

This implementation is straightforward:
- It takes a single parameter `x`
- It returns the result of multiplying `x` by itself, which calculates the square of the input
- The function will work with both positive and negative numbers, as well as zero
- It matches the test case in the `index.mjs` file, which checks that `square(5)` returns `25`

The function is simple and directly solves the problem of squaring a number by multiplying it by itself.
