I'll help implement the `reverseString` function. Since only `functions.mjs` needs to be updated, here's the change:

**functions.mjs**

```js
export function reverseString(str) {
  return str.split('').reverse().join('');
}
```

This implementation:
1. Takes the input string `str`
2. Splits it into an array of characters using `split('')`
3. Reverses the array using `reverse()`
4. Joins it back into a string using `join('')`

The test in `index.mjs` expects "OpenAI" to become "IAnepO", which this implementation will correctly produce. The original `index.mjs` file doesn't need any changes as it's already set up correctly to test this function.
