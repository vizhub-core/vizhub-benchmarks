```javascript
/**
 * Multiply function to calculate the product of two numbers.
 *
 * @param {number} a - The first operand.
 * @param {number} b - The second operand.
 * @returns {number} - The product of a and b.
 */
export function multiply(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}
```

This updated function takes two numbers as input, `a` and `b`, and returns their product. The logic is straightforward, simply returning the product of `a` and `b`.
