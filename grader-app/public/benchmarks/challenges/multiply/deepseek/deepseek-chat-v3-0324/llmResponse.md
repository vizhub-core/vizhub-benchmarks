I'll help implement the multiply function to pass the test. Since the test expects multiply(6, 7) to return 42, we need to update functions.mjs to correctly multiply two numbers.

Here's the updated file:

**functions.mjs**

```js
export function multiply(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}
```

The index.mjs file doesn't need any changes as it's just running the test. The implementation is now complete - the multiply function will correctly multiply its two arguments and return the result.

The test will pass because:
1. 6 * 7 equals 42
2. The function returns exactly this multiplication result
3. The unit test in index.mjs verifies this exact case
