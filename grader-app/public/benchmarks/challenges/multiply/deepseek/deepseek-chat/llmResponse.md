**functions.mjs**

```js
// Implement the multiply function to return the product of two numbers
export function multiply(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}
```

The `index.mjs` file is correct and doesn't need to be changed. I've only updated `functions.mjs` to implement the `multiply` function that returns the product of its two parameters. This implementation will pass the unit test in `index.mjs` since 6 * 7 equals the expected result of 42.
