I'll help implement the `toUpperCase` function in `functions.mjs`. Only this file needs to be modified since the implementation is missing.

**functions.mjs**

```js
export function toUpperCase(str) {
  return str.toUpperCase();
}
```

The `index.mjs` file doesn't need any changes as it already contains the correct test case. The implementation is straightforward using JavaScript's built-in `toUpperCase()` string method.

This change will make the test pass since calling `toUpperCase("hello")` will return "HELLO" as expected by the test case in `index.mjs`.
