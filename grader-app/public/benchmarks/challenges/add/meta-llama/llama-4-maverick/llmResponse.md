To implement the 'add' function in functions.mjs and pass the test in index.mjs, we first need to understand the requirements. The task is to correctly add two numbers (a+b) using the 'add' function.

The test in index.mjs checks if the result of add(3,4) equals 7. If the result is not 7, it logs an error message and exits the process with a non-zero status code. If the result is 7, it logs a success message and exits with a zero status code.

Let's start by examining the 'add' function in functions.mjs. The function is currently not implemented. 

To correctly add two numbers, we simply need to return their sum.

**functions.mjs**

```javascript
// Implement the add function to correctly add two numbers
export function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

The index.mjs file is already correctly implemented with a test for the 'add' function. Therefore, no changes are needed in index.mjs.

**index.mjs**

```javascript
import { add } from "./functions.mjs";

// A simple test:
const result = add(3,4);
if (result !==7) {
  console.error(`Test failed: expected 7, got ${result}`);
  process.exit(1); // Exit with error code
}
console.log("Add test passed");
process.exit(0); // Exit successfully
```

With this implementation, the 'add' function will correctly add two numbers, and the test in index.mjs will pass, logging "Add test passed" to the console. 

No other files need to be updated or created for this task. The provided files are sufficient, and no unused files are present that need to be deleted. 

Therefore, the solution involves only updating the functions.mjs file as shown above, while keeping index.mjs unchanged.
