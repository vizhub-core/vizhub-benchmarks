# Evaluation Methodology for AI Code Generation Quality Assessment

## Abstract

This document describes the methodology for systematic evaluation of AI-generated code quality across multiple dimensions, designed to generate high-quality training datasets for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and establish benchmarks for code generation capabilities.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Motivation

Current AI code generation benchmarks primarily focus on functional correctness (Chen et al., 2021; Austin et al., 2021) but neglect critical aspects of code quality including maintainability, readability, and aesthetic design. This evaluation framework addresses this gap by implementing multi-dimensional human assessment of AI-generated visualizations and algorithms.

### 1.2 Objectives

1. **Generate training datasets** compatible with RLHF methodologies (Christiano et al., 2017; Ouyang et al., 2022)
2. **Establish benchmarks** for multi-dimensional code quality assessment
3. **Enable reproducible research** through standardized evaluation protocols
4. **Support model selection** based on human-validated quality metrics

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### 2.1 Assessment Dimensions

Our evaluation employs a **two-dimensional rating system** based on software engineering principles:

#### 2.1.1 Technical Quality (1-5 scale)
- **Functional Correctness**: Code executes without errors and meets requirements
- **Algorithmic Efficiency**: Appropriate data structures and time complexity
- **Code Structure**: Logical organization, modularity, and best practices
- **Error Handling**: Robust handling of edge cases and error conditions

#### 2.1.2 Aesthetic Quality (1-5 scale)  
- **Visual Design**: Clear, intuitive, and visually appealing output
- **User Experience**: Accessibility, responsiveness, and usability
- **Design Principles**: Effective use of color, typography, and layout
- **Professional Polish**: Production-ready appearance and behavior

### 2.2 Rating Scale Interpretation

Following established practices in human evaluation research (Liang et al., 2022):

| Score | Technical Quality | Aesthetic Quality |
|-------|------------------|-------------------|
| 5 | Exceptional: Production-ready, exemplary code | Outstanding: Professional design standards |
| 4 | Good: Minor improvements needed | Good: Solid visual design |
| 3 | Adequate: Meets basic requirements | Adequate: Functional but basic |
| 2 | Poor: Significant issues present | Poor: Substandard design |
| 1 | Failing: Major errors or non-functional | Failing: Unusable or broken |

## 3. Data Collection Protocol

### 3.1 Challenge Design

**Visualization Challenges** are designed to test multiple coding competencies:
- **Data Processing**: CSV parsing, data transformation
- **Algorithm Implementation**: Mathematical computations, sorting, filtering  
- **Visualization Generation**: D3.js, HTML/CSS, SVG manipulation
- **User Interface**: Responsive design, accessibility, interactivity

**Example Challenge Structure**:
```
Challenge: stockPriceChart
├── Requirements: Specific technical and visual specifications
├── Input Data: Standardized CSV format with temporal stock data
├── Expected Output: Interactive bar chart with D3.js
└── Evaluation Criteria: Technical implementation + aesthetic design
```

### 3.2 Model Selection

We evaluate representative models across major AI providers:
- **OpenAI**: GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo
- **Anthropic**: Claude-3.5, Claude-3-haiku  
- **Meta**: Llama-3.1, Llama-3.2 (multiple sizes)
- **DeepSeek**: DeepSeek-Coder, DeepSeek-R1
- **Alibaba**: Qwen-2.5-Coder, QwQ-32B

This selection ensures coverage of different architectural approaches, training methodologies, and capability levels.

### 3.3 Human Evaluator Selection

**Evaluator Qualifications**:
- Professional experience in data visualization (minimum 2 years)
- Expertise in web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, D3.js)
- Understanding of UI/UX design principles
- Familiarity with software engineering best practices

**Quality Assurance**:
- All evaluators are domain experts in data visualization
- Evaluation guidelines provided for consistency
- Regular review of edge cases and borderline ratings
- Documentation of rationale for complex decisions

## 4. Statistical Analysis

### 4.1 Inter-Rater Reliability

We measure agreement between evaluators using established metrics:

**Pearson Correlation Coefficient** for continuous ratings:
```
r = Σ((xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ)) / √(Σ(xi - x̄)² Σ(yi - ȳ)²)
```

**Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC)** for multiple raters:
```
ICC = (MSB - MSW) / (MSB + (k-1)MSW)
```

Where MSB = mean square between subjects, MSW = mean square within subjects, k = number of raters.

**Acceptance Criteria**: ICC ≥ 0.70 indicates acceptable reliability (Cicchetti, 1994).

### 4.2 Consensus Scoring

For training dataset generation, we calculate consensus scores:

**Technical Consensus**:
```
Technical_consensus = Σ(wi × Technical_scorei) / Σ(wi)
```

**Aesthetic Consensus**:  
```
Aesthetic_consensus = Σ(wi × Aesthetic_scorei) / Σ(wi)
```

Where `wi` represents evaluator weight (uniform weighting: wi = 1).

**Overall Quality Score**:
```
Overall_quality = (Technical_consensus + Aesthetic_consensus) / 2
```

### 4.3 Confidence Intervals

We calculate 95% confidence intervals for consensus scores:
```
CI = consensus_score ± (1.96 × σ / √n)
```

Where σ = standard deviation of ratings, n = number of evaluators.

## 5. RLHF Dataset Generation

### 5.1 Preference Pair Creation

Following Anthropic's methodology (Bai et al., 2022), we create preference pairs by:

1. **Ranking models** by overall quality score for each challenge
2. **Selecting pairs** with meaningful quality differences (Δ ≥ 0.5 points)
3. **Assigning labels**: Higher-rated solution = "chosen", lower-rated = "rejected"
4. **Quality filtering**: Exclude pairs with insufficient score separation

### 5.2 Dataset Schema

```json
{
  "prompt": "Challenge description and requirements",
  "chosen": "Higher-quality code solution", 
  "rejected": "Lower-quality code solution",
  "metadata": {
    "challenge": "stockPriceChart",
    "chosen_model": "qwen/qwq-32b",
    "rejected_model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1", 
    "chosen_scores": {
      "technical": 5.0,
      "aesthetic": 4.8,
      "overall": 4.9,
      "confidence_interval": [4.7, 5.1],
      "vote_count": 3
    },
    "rejected_scores": {
      "technical": 3.2,
      "aesthetic": 2.8, 
      "overall": 3.0,
      "confidence_interval": [2.8, 3.2],
      "vote_count": 3
    },
    "score_difference": 1.9,
    "dataset_version": "1.0.0",
    "evaluation_date": "2025-06-03"
  }
}
```

## 6. Bias Mitigation

- **Blinding**: Evaluators unaware of which model generated each solution
- **Counterbalancing**: Systematic rotation of presentation order

### 6.2 Evaluator Bias
- **Multiple evaluators**: Minimum 2 evaluators per challenge/model pair
- **Expert selection**: Domain experts reduce subjective interpretation variance
- **Documentation**: Rationale recorded for controversial decisions

### 6.3 Selection Bias
- **Representative sampling**: Models selected across capability levels and providers
- **Challenge diversity**: Multiple challenge types test different competencies
- **Transparency**: Full methodology and data collection process documented

## 7. Reproducibility

### 7.1 Data Availability
- **Training datasets**: Available in standardized JSONL format
- **Raw evaluations**: Individual grader scores preserved with metadata
- **Challenge specifications**: Complete requirements and test cases provided
- **Code artifacts**: All generated solutions archived with version control

### 7.2 Replication Package
