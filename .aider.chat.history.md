#### Add "EJ Fox" as a contributor.  

I'll add "EJ Fox" as a contributor to the package.json file. In the JSON format, the "author" field can be a string or an object. Since it's currently a string with just one author, I'll modify it to include both authors.

package.json
```json
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  "author": "Curran Kelleher",
=======
  "author": "Curran Kelleher, EJ Fox",
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```
