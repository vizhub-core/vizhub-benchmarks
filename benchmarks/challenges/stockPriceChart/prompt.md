Create a bar chart showing AAPL stock prices over time using D3.js. The chart should:
1. Be implemented in index.html using D3.js (v7+).
2. Load data from data.csv.
3. Render SVG bars inside the #chart div.
4. Include X (time) and Y (price) axes with labels.
5. Use a time scale for the X-axis and a linear scale for the Y-axis.
6. Add a title to the chart (e.g., 'AAPL Stock Price Over Time').
7. Display the price value as text on top of or near each bar.
8. Ensure the visualization is responsive or fits within an 800x600 viewport.
9. Add basic styling (e.g., bar color, axis appearance) either in a <style> tag or inline.
