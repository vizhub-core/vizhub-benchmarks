**functions.mjs**

```js
export function toUpperCase(str) {
  return str.toUpperCase();
}
```

The `index.mjs` file remains unchanged as it was correctly implemented to test the `toUpperCase` function.

The implementation in `functions.mjs` simply uses the built-in JavaScript `toUpperCase()` method, which converts all the characters in the string to uppercase. This is the most direct and efficient way to achieve the desired functionality.
