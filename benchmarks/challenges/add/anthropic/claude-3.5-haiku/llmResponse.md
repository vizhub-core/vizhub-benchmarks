To solve this task, I'll implement the `add` function in `functions.mjs`:

**functions.mjs**

```js
export function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

The implementation is straightforward:
- It takes two parameters `a` and `b`
- Uses the `+` operator to add them together
- Returns the result

This will pass the test in `index.mjs` which checks if `add(3, 4)` returns `7`.

The function will:
- Work with positive numbers
- Work with negative numbers 
- Correctly handle adding integers

No changes are needed to `index.mjs`, as the test case is already set up correctly.
