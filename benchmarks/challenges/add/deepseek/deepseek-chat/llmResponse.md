I'll help implement the 'add' function in functions.mjs to pass the test in index.mjs. Here are the updated files:

**functions.mjs**

```js
export function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

**index.mjs**

```js
import { add } from "./functions.mjs";

// A simple test:
const result = add(3, 4);
if (result !== 7) {
  console.error(`Test failed: expected 7, got ${result}`);
  process.exit(1); // Exit with error code
}
console.log("Add test passed");
process.exit(0); // Exit successfully
```

The implementation is straightforward - the `add` function simply returns the sum of its two parameters. The test in index.mjs verifies that 3 + 4 equals 7, which this implementation satisfies. No changes were needed to index.mjs since it was already correctly set up to test the add function.
