Based on the task, I only need to implement the `add` function in `functions.mjs` to make the test pass. The `index.mjs` file is correct and doesn't need any changes. Here's the updated file:

**functions.mjs**

```js
export function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

The implementation is straightforward - the function simply returns the sum of its two parameters. This will make the test in `index.mjs` pass since 3 + 4 equals 7.
