I'll help implement the `add` function in functions.mjs to pass the test in index.mjs. Since index.mjs is already correct and just needs a working implementation, I'll only update functions.mjs:

**functions.mjs**

```js
// TODO: Implement the add function
export function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

The implementation is simple - it just needs to return the sum of the two parameters `a` and `b`. The test in index.mjs verifies that 3 + 4 equals 7, so this implementation will satisfy that requirement.

No changes are needed to index.mjs as it's already correctly set up to test the add function.
