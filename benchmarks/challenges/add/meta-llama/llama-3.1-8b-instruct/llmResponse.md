**functions.mjs**

```javascript
// Implemented the add function correctly
export function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

```

This file simply implements the add function as it should be. It takes two numbers as inputs, `a` and `b`, and returns their sum.

This change will pass the test in `index.mjs`.
