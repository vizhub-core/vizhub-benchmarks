## Implementation of the ReverseString Function

To complete the implementation of the `reverseString` function, we need to iterate through the input string and extract each character, storing it in a new string in reverse order.

Here are the updated files:

**functions.mjs**

```javascript
// Entire updated code for functions.mjs
export function reverseString(str) {
  let reversed = "";
  for (let i = str.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    reversed += str[i];
  }
  return reversed;
}
```

With this implementation, the `reverseString` function will successfully reverse the input string as expected.

The provided test case in **index.mjs** will pass and produce the expected output `"IAnepO"`.
