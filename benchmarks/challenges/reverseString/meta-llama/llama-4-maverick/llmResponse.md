To implement the `reverseString` function, we need to understand the task and the requirements. The task is to reverse a given string. For example, if the input is "OpenAI", the output should be "IAnepO".

## Step 1: Understand the task
The task requires implementing a function named `reverseString` that takes a string as input and returns the reversed string.

## Step 2: Implement the `reverseString` function
To reverse a string, we can split it into an array of characters, reverse the array, and then join the characters back into a string. This can be achieved using JavaScript's built-in string and array methods: `split`, `reverse`, and `join`.

## Step 3: Write the code for `reverseString`
The `reverseString` function can be implemented in the `functions.mjs` file.

## Step 4: Test the implementation
The `index.mjs` file already contains a test for the `reverseString` function. We should ensure that our implementation passes this test.

## Step 5: Provide the updated code
We will update `functions.mjs` with the implementation of `reverseString`. The `index.mjs` file is already correctly set up to test the function, so no changes are needed there.

**functions.mjs**

```javascript
export function reverseString(str) {
  return str.split("").reverse().join("");
}
```

**index.mjs**

```javascript
import { reverseString } from "./functions.mjs";

const input = "OpenAI";
const expected = "IAnepO"; // Corrected expected output

const result = reverseString(input);
if (result !== expected) {
  console.error(`Test failed: expected '${expected}', but got '${result}'`);
  process.exit(1);
}
console.log("reverseString test passed");
process.exit(0);
```

Since both files are correctly updated or remain the same as per the task requirements, the above code represents the solution. No other files need to be updated or created for this task.
