I'll solve this by implementing the `reverseString` function in `functions.mjs`.

**functions.mjs**

```js
export function reverseString(str) {
  return str.split('').reverse().join('');
}
```

The implementation does the following:
1. `str.split('')` converts the string into an array of characters
2. `.reverse()` reverses the order of the characters
3. `.join('')` converts the array back into a string

This concise solution will reverse the input string, matching the expected output in the test case. The function takes a string as input and returns the reversed version of that string.

No changes are needed to `index.mjs`, as the test script is already correctly set up.
