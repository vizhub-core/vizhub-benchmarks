I'll solve this by implementing the `reverseString` function in the `functions.mjs` file:

**functions.mjs**

```js
export function reverseString(str) {
  return str.split('').reverse().join('');
}
```

This implementation does the following:
1. `str.split('')` converts the string into an array of characters
2. `.reverse()` reverses the order of the array
3. `.join('')` converts the array back into a string

The function will:
- Take a string as input
- Reverse the characters in the string
- Return the reversed string

In this case, when given the input "OpenAI", it will return "IAnepO" as expected by the test in `index.mjs`.

The implementation is concise, readable, and uses built-in JavaScript string and array methods to efficiently reverse the string.

No changes are needed to `index.mjs` as the test script is already correctly set up.
