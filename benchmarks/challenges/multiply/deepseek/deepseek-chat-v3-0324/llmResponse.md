I'll help implement the multiply function to pass the test. Here's the updated file:

**functions.mjs**

```js
export function multiply(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}
```

The test file `index.mjs` doesn't need any changes as it's already correctly set up to test the multiply function. The implementation simply needs to return the product of the two input numbers, which is what we've done here.

The test expects 6 * 7 to equal 42, and our implementation will correctly return that result.
