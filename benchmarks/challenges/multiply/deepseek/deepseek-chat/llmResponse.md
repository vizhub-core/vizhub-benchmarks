I'll help implement the multiply function to pass the test. Only the `functions.mjs` file needs to be updated since the test in `index.mjs` is correct and doesn't need changes.

**functions.mjs**

```js
export function multiply(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}
```

The implementation is straightforward - we just need to return the product of the two input parameters `a` and `b`. This will make the test pass since 6 * 7 equals 42, which is what the test expects.

The `index.mjs` file can remain exactly as it is since it's already properly testing the multiply function.
