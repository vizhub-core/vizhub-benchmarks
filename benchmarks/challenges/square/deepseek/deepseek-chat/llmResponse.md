I'll implement the 'square' function in functions.mjs. Here's the updated file:

**functions.mjs**

```js
// Implemented the square function
export function square(x) {
  return x * x;
}
```

The index.mjs file remains unchanged as it already correctly imports and tests the square function. Here it is for completeness:

**index.mjs**

```js
import { square } from "./functions.mjs";

const input = 5;
const result = square(input);
if (result !== 25) {
  console.error(`Test failed: expected 25, got ${result}`);
  process.exit(1);
}
console.log("Square test passed");
process.exit(0);
```

The implementation simply returns the result of multiplying the input x by itself, satisfying the requirement to calculate the square of a number.
