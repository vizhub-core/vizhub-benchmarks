**functions.mjs**

```js
export function square(x) {
  return x * x;
}
```

The `index.mjs` file is already correct and doesn't need any changes, so I'm only including the updated `functions.mjs` file. The implementation of the `square` function simply returns the product of `x` with itself, which is mathematically equivalent to `xÂ²`.
