I'll implement the square function in functions.mjs. Here's the updated file:

**functions.mjs**

```js
export function square(x) {
  return x * x;
}
```

The index.mjs file doesn't need any changes as it's already correctly testing the square function. The implementation is simple - it just returns the input multiplied by itself. This will pass the test case in index.mjs which expects 5 squared to be 25.
