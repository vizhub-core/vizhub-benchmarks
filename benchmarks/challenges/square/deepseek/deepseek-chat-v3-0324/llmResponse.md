I'll help implement the square function in functions.mjs. Here's the updated file:

**functions.mjs**

```js
export function square(x) {
  return x * x;
}
```

The index.mjs file doesn't need any changes as it's already correctly set up to test the square function. The implementation simply returns the input multiplied by itself, which satisfies the test case in index.mjs where it expects 5 squared to be 25.
