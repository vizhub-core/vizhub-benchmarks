I'll help implement the square function in functions.mjs. Here's the updated file:

**functions.mjs**

```js
export function square(x) {
  return x * x;
}
```

The index.mjs file doesn't need any changes as it's already correctly set up to test the square function. The implementation is simple - we just need to return the input multiplied by itself.

The test in index.mjs will now pass since square(5) will correctly return 25.
